      <h2 id="social-logins">HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our
        Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain
        information about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-retention">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as
        necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
        otherwise required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="data-security">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information
        through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.

      <h2 id="minors">DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or
        market to children under 18 years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children
        under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
        information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependentâs use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at{" "}

        <strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the
        US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United
        Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you
        greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
        review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
        country, province, or state of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
        certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
        the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
        information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
        the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data

        If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data

      <p>
        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
        consent to process your personal information, which may be express
        and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
        right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
        consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
        provided in the section `HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?`
        below or updating your preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

      <p>
        <strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong>{" "}
        You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at
        any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,
        or by contacting us using the details provided in the section `HOW CAN
        YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?` below. You will then be removed from
        the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you â for
        example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the
        administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests,
        or for other non-marketing purposes.

      <h2 id="dnt-controls">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (`DNT`) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

      <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>

      <p>
        Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request
        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been
        validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable
        laws.
      </p>
      <h3>Request Verification</h3>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
      </p>
      <h3>Appeals</h3>
      <p>
        Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take
        action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing
        us at <a href="mailto:privacy@outspokn.com">privacy@outspokn.com</a>. We
        will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response
        to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the
        decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your
        state attorney general.
